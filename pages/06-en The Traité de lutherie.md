The Traité de Lutherie

The "Traité" sheds a new light on the history of violin making and solves the mystery of the origin of the violin's form.
The reading deeply introduce us into the mysteries of the most iconic forms (like those of Amati and Stradivari). Craftman, theorist and curious are getting caught out by a singular approach steeped in oral unrecognized tradition.
This original work met an international success.

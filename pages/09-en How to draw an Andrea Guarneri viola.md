The form of an instrument begins with the "framework" which is its whole surface divided proportionally.

The segments of the framework are tied in a specific proportional relations so-called "analogic".

Then, these proportional segments are used as the radius of the arcs that trace the outline of the form.

As an example, this animation of the viola Guarneri drawing illustrates this process step by step.
